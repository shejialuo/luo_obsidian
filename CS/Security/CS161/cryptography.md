# Cryptography

## Introduction to Cryptography

There are three main goals of cryptography:

+ Confidentiality: preventing adversaries from reading our private data.
+ Integrity: preventing attackers from altering some data.
+ Authenticity: ensuring that the expected user created some data.

There are two ways of modern cryptography:

+ Symmetric-key cryptography: the same secret key is used by both endpoints of a
communication.
+ Public-key (asymmetric-key) cryptography: sender and receiver use different
keys.

## Kerckhoff's Principle

+ Crypto systems should remain secure even when the attacker knows all internal
details of the algorithm/system.
+ The key should be the only thing that must be kept secret, and the system
should be designed to make it easy to change keys that are leaked (or suspected
to be leaked).

There are three reasons:

+ If your secrets are leaked, it is usually a lot easier to change the key than
to replace every instance of the running software + You want to people to
analyze and improve the algorithm.
+ Multiple different people (with different trust models) should be able to use
the algorithm.

## Symmetric Encryption Scheme

+ `keygen() -> K`
+ `Enc(K, M) -> C`
+ `Dec(K, C) -> M`
+ Correctness: $\forall K, \forall M, (Enc(K,M) \to C) \to (Dec(K,C) = M)$.
+ Security: No partial information about $M$ may leak! Because
an adversary can couple it with side information to reconstruct $M$.

### IND-CPA

To formally define no partial information leak, we define the game
IND-CPA.

### Block Ciphers

## Asymmetric Encryption

For asymmetric encryption, Alice would produce a public key and a private key.
Also, Bob would produce a public key and a private key.  When Alice wants to
send the message to Bob, Alice uses Bob's public key to encrypt the message, and
Bob uses its private key to decrypt the message.

So for encrypt function, it should be a one-way function.

### Discrete Logarithm

Discrete Logarithm is a famous one-way function.

$$
\begin{align*}
f(x) = g^{x} \mod p, &p \text{ is a large prime (2048 bits long)} \\
&g \text{ is a random value in } [2,p - 1]
\end{align*}
$$

## Integrity and Authentication

Sometimes, we do *NOT* care about confidentiality but integrity and
authentication.

### Message Authentication Codes (MACs)

For symmetric, we use ASE-EMAC to provide MAC, for asymmetric, we use digital
signature to provide MAC.
