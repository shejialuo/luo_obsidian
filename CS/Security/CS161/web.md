# Web

## Same-Origin-Policy

The same-origin-policy means one origin should not be able to access the
resources of another origin. And javascript on one page cannot read or modify
pages from different origins.

+ The origin of a page is derived from the URL it was loaded from.
+ Special cases: Javascript runs with the origin of the page that loaded it.

### Origin

+ Granularity of protection of same origin policy
+ Origin = (protocol, hostname, port)
+ It's a **string match**! If these match, it is same origin, else it is not.
Even though in some cases, it is logically the same origin, if there is no
match, it is not.

## SQL Injection

Attacker user provides bad input and web server does not check input format
which enables attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

There are some ways to prevent SQL injection:

+ Sanitizate user input: check or enforce that value/string does not have
commands of any sort.
  + Disallow special characters
  + Escape input string
+ Avoid building a SQL command based on raw user input, use existing tools or
frameworks
+ Use parameterized/prepared SQL

## XSS

XSS is Cross-site scripting attack. Attacker injects a *malicious script* into
the webpage viewed by a victim user. Script runs in user's browser with access
to page's data.

### Stored XSS

For stored XSS, attacker leaves Javascript lying around on web service for
victim to load.

+ The attacker manages to store a malicious script at the web server.
+ The server later unwittingly sends script to a victim's browser.
+ Browser runs script in the same origin.

### Reflected XSS

For reflected XSS, attacker gets user to click on specially-crafted URL with
script in it, web service reflects it back.

+ The attacker gets the victim user to visit a URL that embeds a malicious
JavaScript
+ The server echoes it back to victim user in its response.
+ Victim's browser executes the script within the same origin.

## CSRF

CSRF is cross site request forgery.

![CSRF](https://s2.loli.net/2022/06/17/Tv6YIzMPijcwxbd.png)

+ User logs in to bank.com, session cookie remains in browser state.
+ User visits malicious site containing:

  ```html
  <form name=F action=http://bank.com/BillPay.php>
  <input name=recipient value=badguy> ...
  <script> document.F.submit(); </script>
  ```

+ Browser sends user auth cookie with request

There are three basic ways to defend CSRF:

+ CSRF token: embed a new token in the web

  ```html
  <input type=hidden value=23a3af01b>
  ```

+ Referer Validation

  ```txt
  Referer: http://www.facebook.com/home.php
  ```

+ Custom HTTP Header (User LocalStorage to store the session, and add the value
to the header).
